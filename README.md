# Munch Meter

Swiping into a dining hall ($17 dollars) only to get an iced coffee, wasting food because it didn't taste as good as it looked, and waiting too long for a meal that you have to scarf down before class. 
Even though we do our dining hall research online beforehand, sometimes the menu isn't an accurate representation of the actual offerings, and at some locations, there is no online menu. 
To be perfectly honest, finding the right places to eat to get the most out of your dining plan requires a lot of mental energy--a satisfying meal should not be difficult or time-consuming to find.
